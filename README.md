# card_game

Card game simulation between two computer players. Every player initially gets 20 random cards. At each step, each player turns the first card out of his
deck and the one with the higher card picks both up and puts them in his pile below. In case both cards are the same, 
each player turns four more from his deck and whoever has the the highest last card, picks it all up. If the cards at the top are the same again, the process is repeated until
the top cards are not different in size. If a player runs out of cards in this process, he automatically loses. The game continues until one player wins all the cards.
